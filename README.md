# Qile Yang's Curriculum Vitae

`cv-qile-yang.pdf` is the CV itself, built with LaTeX. 

## Building

Compile `main.tex` with some LaTex distribution with the repo root as the working directory to build the PDF from scratch.

If using vscode on linux, the `.vscode/settings.json` file is already configured to use `latexmk` to build the PDF, and outputting the resulting pdf into the root of this repo. (Configuration taken from <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/672590>)
