# Qile Yang's Curriculum Vitae

`cv-qile-yang.pdf` is the CV itself, built with LaTeX. 

## Building

Compile `main.tex` with `lualatex` with the repo root as the working directory to build the PDF from scratch.

If using latex workshop on vscode on linux (including WSL) - the committed vscode settings should automatically handle compilation on save.
